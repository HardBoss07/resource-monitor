## üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source (For Developers)

If you wish to build Resource Monitor from its source code, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (with `rustup`)

* [Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) (installed via npm)

* For Windows builds, ensure you have the necessary build tools (e.g., Visual Studio Build Tools).

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HardBoss07/resource-monitor.git
    cd resource-monitor
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Next.js for Static Export:**
    Ensure your `next.config.js` file at the project root includes:

    ```javascript
    // next.config.js
    /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
    const nextConfig = {
      output: 'export', // This enables static HTML export
      images: {
        unoptimized: true, // Crucial if you use Next.js Image component with static export
      },
      // ... other configurations
    };
    module.exports = nextConfig;
    ```

    *Note: With `output: 'export'` configured in `next.config.js`, `next build` will automatically generate the static assets into the `out/` directory.*

4.  **Configure Tauri:**
    Ensure your `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` file includes:

    ```json
    // src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
    {
      // ...
      "build": {
        "beforeDevCommand": "npm run dev",
        "beforeBuildCommand": "npm run build", // `next export` is handled by next.config.js
        "devUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
        "frontendDist": "../out" // Points to Next.js static export output
      },
      // ...
    }
    ```

    And your `package.json` build script:

    ```json
    // package.json
    "scripts": {
      "build": "next build", // `next export` is handled by next.config.js
      "tauri": "tauri",
      // ...
    },
    ```

### Running in Development Mode
